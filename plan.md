# Photo Map
1. extract.py done: takes directory as input, outputs dict with gps 
2. routemaker: take dict from extract, rank by dates (can do this in 1 if easier), according to color maybe? drop pins in each spot 
(use mapbox)



# To do list:
1. Have error catching for img files without location data
